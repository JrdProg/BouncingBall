# BouncingBall

To create a bouncing ball with motion effects in Python, you can use the Pygame library. Motion effects could include acceleration, deceleration, or even gravity. Here's an example of a bouncing ball with acceleration due to gravity:


# Desktop
First, make sure you have Pygame installed. You can install it using pip:
```
pip install pygame
```

After pygame installed create a Python script for the bouncing ball animation with motion effects copy code from <a href="https://github.com/JrdProg/BouncingBall/blob/1d281acb8906ca866474ad8da479a84c4d48102f/bouncingball.py">bouncingball.py</a>


# Mobile
If you're using mobile just download a python IDE: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iiec.pydroid3">Python 3 IDE</a>

This code creates a bouncing ball with motion effects, including acceleration due to gravity and bouncing off the walls and floor. You can adjust the GRAVITY constant and other parameters to customize the motion effects to your liking.
